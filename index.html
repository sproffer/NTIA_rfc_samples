1. AI technologies are increasingly being incorporated into consumer technology without adequate consideration of potential risks and impacts.<br/>2. Most AI systems are based on algorithms and data controlled by large tech companies, some of which have disbanded their ethics teams or have executives who resist criticism of their work.<br/>3. There is a need for stricter guidelines on AI technology capabilities and use, as well as protections for data collection and model training.<br/>4. Companies using AI technologies should adhere to principles of transparency, accountability, and ethical participation, including disclosing training data, language model sources, and product capabilities.<br/>5. Transparency should encompass a comprehensive report of data sources used in model training, particularly for companies that publish APIs for software developers.<br/>6. Accountability should include well-defined rules for potential harm caused by AI technology, assessed by a diverse group of technology builders, social scientists, academics, and marginalized communities.<br/>7. Companies that build large language models should permit third-party audits of their data sources, storage, and use.<br/>8. Ethical participation should involve a clear explanation of the company's approach to AI system use, including transparency, accountability for system misuse, and compliance with information requests about system creation.<br/>9. The NTIA should take into account issues of technological antitrust, individual copyright agency, and human rights protections in their AI accountability requirements.<br/>10. The current system favors large corporations, and regulation could further restrict competition from smaller agencies, open source communities, and individuals.

1. The user believes AI should not be used in certain areas of human society, such as government, legislature, court, and judicial processes due to potential negative impacts on marginalized people and democracy.<br/>2. The use of AI in other areas, such as mental health products, is open for debate.<br/>3. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) has made comments on the topic of transparency in AI contents.<br/>4. The advancement of generative AI has led to a significant increase in AI-generated content, which could make content moderation on social media platforms more challenging.<br/>5. Policymakers should enforce a labeling requirement for AI-generated content, similar to other product labeling laws.<br/>6. AI algorithms are often designed to persuade users to make certain decisions, which can sometimes involve providing favorable but less truthful information.<br/>7. The government should provide high-level guidance on the social and economic impact of policies, with third-party auditors responsible for defining detailed criteria.<br/>8. The auditors for AI should be independent and not affiliated with AI vendors, similar to private funded financial audits.<br/>9. Vendors are encouraged to self-examine and disclose potential harms with auditors, even if the information is proprietary.<br/>10. In the initial phase, AI vendors can self-test to confirm compliance with government guidelines, without the involvement of third-party auditors.

1. The U.S. Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) has issued a request for public comment on AI Accountability Policy.<br/>2. The Center for Responsible AI at New York University (NYU R/AI) was established in 2020 to advance responsible AI through research, dialogue, and technical collaborations.<br/>3. NYU R/AI has worked on public education initiatives, including a course called "We are AI: Taking control of technology," and two comic book series.<br/>4. The concept of contextual transparency, which integrates social science, engineering, and information design to improve Algorithmic Decision Systems (ADS) transparency, was introduced by Sloane and Stoyanovich.<br/>5. The authors suggest that AI accountability mechanisms should consider the AI lifecycle, and technical accountability primitives should be integrated directly into the data lifecycle management.<br/>6. The study shows that it is often possible to reproduce results of peer-reviewed social science papers over privacy-preserving synthetic versions of public datasets.<br/>7. The NYU R/AI team has been developing educational materials and methodologies, teaching responsible AI to various groups including the public, data scientists, government accountability professionals, librarians, and practitioners at several large commercial entities.<br/>8. The lack of a general federal data protection or privacy law is a barrier to effective AI accountability.<br/>9. The federal government should fund responsible AI education initiatives and support small and medium-sized businesses in their transition into responsible AI.<br/>10. Julia Stoyanovich, Arnaud Sahuguet, and Gerhard Weikum have worked on a platform for responsible data science named Fides.

1. The submission is for a request for comment on AI Accountability Policy, aiming to gather diverse perspectives on AI accountability.<br/>2. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration issued a notice on 04/13/2023, authored by Kassandra Popper, a software developer.<br/>3. AI accountability mechanisms should ensure AI products function as advertised and according to industry norms, with audits for quality assurance and investigation of product issues.<br/>4. AI accountability practices can provide a competitive advantage for AI industry participants, even without legal standards.<br/>5. AI accountability goals such as not contributing to harmful discrimination, being safe and legal, should be treated within the context of the AI system's application domain.<br/>6. Over-regulation of the AI industry could impede progress in AI R&D and delay the development of more trustworthy AI systems.<br/>7. AI Accountability should focus on two parts of the value chain: data collection for training a machine learning system and the distribution of the AI system to the customer or other affected person.<br/>8. AI Accountability measures should be mandatory for applications where there is a significant risk of serious or permanent harm to people or property.<br/>9. The absence of a federal law specifically for AI systems is not a hindrance to effective AI accountability, as AI systems can be regulated at various governmental levels.<br/>10. AI accountability policies should be sector-specific due to unique application requirements in each sector, with regulation focusing on inputs to validation, especially data needed to confirm a product's functionality and fitness for purpose.

1. The Integrity Institute has responded to the NTIA's "AI Accountability Policy Request for Comment," emphasizing the importance of understanding the real-life implications of irresponsibly deploying AI systems.<br/>2. The Institute's co-founders, Sahar Massachi and Jeff Allen, express their desire to remain engaged in future efforts in this area.<br/>3. The Integrity Institute is a think tank composed of tech professionals experienced in integrity roles within social internet platforms.<br/>4. The Institute aims to share its expertise with those involved in the creation and governance of the social internet, focusing on AI developments, particularly generative AI.<br/>5. The Institute advocates for the early incorporation of safety, fairness, and transparency in AI development.<br/>6. AI accountability mechanisms such as certifications, audits, and assessments should contribute to transparency and explainability of the AI system and its use.<br/>7. AI accountability mechanisms should demonstrate that the producers of AI systems understand how their systems are working and have fully studied the system design and outcomes.<br/>8. AI accountability practices may not have meaningful impact without legal standards and enforceable risk thresholds.<br/>9. Developers should be legally required to notify any people who use their products that AI systems were used in the production of those products.<br/>10. The current AI development context is characterized by a race to market among industry players, leading to a system of "post-hoc safety" where users provide testing in production.

- Accountability mechanisms can potentially hinder the development of trustworthy AI and impact AI innovation and competitiveness, particularly for smaller developers and startups.<br/>- Strict regulations, such as GDPR, can disproportionately burden small startups and independent developers, impeding their progress and financial stability.<br/>- Stringent accountability measures can deter risk-taking, crucial for innovation, and divert resources away from product development and technological advancement.<br/>- A well-designed regulatory framework should balance the need for accountability with fostering a dynamic and innovative AI sector.<br/>- Accountability in the AI value chain should be end-to-end, with special attention to points of human interaction.<br/>- Blockchain technology could be used to coordinate and communicate accountability efforts across the AI value chain.<br/>- Developers and deployers of AI should keep essential records to support accountability while prioritizing user privacy.<br/>- Significant barriers to effective AI accountability in the private sector include a lack of standardization and insufficient incentives.<br/>- The absence of a general federal data protection or privacy law is a barrier to effective AI accountability.<br/>- AI audits and assessments impose costs, particularly burdensome for smaller businesses. Regulatory frameworks should complement existing workflows rather than add administrative burden.

- Wilhelmina Randtke spoke to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration about AI Accountability Policy.<br/>- Her focus was on question 19, which pertains to public expectations for audits and assessments of AI systems in public programs.<br/>- Randtke stressed the significance of accountability in democratic government, achieved through the rulemaking process.<br/>- She proposed that software implementing government law or policy should undergo the rulemaking process, as it is a form of rule.<br/>- Randtke highlighted that bypassing the rulemaking process when transitioning from paper to electronic processes is a violation.<br/>- She stated that software making decisions about individuals is a rule, as it applies logic consistently to many people.<br/>- Randtke argued that if an agency relies on a piece of code in most cases, it should be considered a rule and should undergo the rulemaking process.<br/>- She maintained that the complexity of the software, the use of a contractor, or the transition from paper to electronic does not exempt it from the rulemaking process.<br/>- Randtke emphasized that the rulemaking process is well established and can accommodate speedy action when needed.<br/>- She concluded by urging federal agencies to send all decision-making software used by the government through the existing and mandatory rulemaking process.

- Knowledge Ecology International (KEI) is a non-profit organization that researches and evaluates domestic and international policies and norms.<br/>- KEI has raised concerns about provisions in several plurilateral trade agreements that restrict the U.S. and other governments' ability to require access to software source code or its corresponding algorithm.<br/>- These provisions are found in the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), the Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA), and the Agreement between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada (USMCA).<br/>- KEI believes these provisions are overly restrictive and lack adequate exceptions, even for software licensed under obligations to make its code public.<br/>- KEI points out that the growing interest in algorithms and AI services has revealed numerous societal risks, many of which are addressed in the NTIA's request for comments on AI Accountability Policy.<br/>- KEI proposes that policy makers should mandate transparency in software code and algorithms in certain areas, and this should not be prohibited by trade agreement provisions.<br/>- KEI notes that the European Commission has established a European Centre for Algorithm transparency and many groups are advocating for transparency measures in AI services.<br/>- KEI concludes that it is unwise to enter into trade agreements that broadly prevent governments from requiring transparency in areas where there is a strong case for government intervention.

- AI technologies pose a threat not only to jobs of artists and creatives but also to the fabric of society, with potential misuse for fabricating information, impersonating real people, and producing harmful content.<br/>- The sophistication of AI technology makes it harder to identify false and synthesized information, enabling bad actors to create specific and mass-disinformation.<br/>- Copyright law is intended to protect an author's sole rights to exploit their creations, including derivatives of their authored creations.<br/>- In the digital world, all art, writing, code, etc., is interpreted by computers as a binary sequence of 1's and 0's, which is also protected by copyright.<br/>- The author retains copyright over the binary sequence representing their creation, even if it has been altered by computer instructions such as compression.<br/>- AI models are derivative products of their training data, obtained by performing computer instructions on the data.<br/>- Each piece of training data is nonfungible and contributes to the final model, making the model directly derivative of the data.<br/>- The Copyright Office's stance that a human can claim copyright over an AI-generated product if they perform sufficient work on it should be reconsidered.<br/>- The final human-worked product is a derivative of the AI-generated product and can usurp the market of the original product, infringing on the original author's copyright.

Generative AI, especially in it's current form, is predicated on taking the work of countless others and just turning it into a slightly different product. It is important to protect creators and other workers from Generative AI's stealing of their hard-work.

- Michael Schwarz, a key figure in AI development, warns about the potential misuse of AI by bad actors, despite advocating for continued development without regulation.<br/>- AI researchers often dismiss concerns about AI misuse, instead focusing on potential benefits such as curing cancer, solving world hunger, and addressing the climate crisis.<br/>- There is no definitive proof that AI can achieve these lofty goals, and current AI systems are known to produce incorrect results.<br/>- AI has already been misused in cases related to intellectual property, such as Google Bard scraping content from web pages, and image generators recreating copyrighted material.<br/>- AI has been used in fraud and propaganda, with deepfake technology being a notable example. According to Regula, 37% of organizations have experienced voice fraud and 29% were victims of deepfake videos.<br/>- The misuse of AI could potentially erode trust in institutions and complicate the criminal justice system, as it becomes increasingly difficult to verify the authenticity of recorded evidence.<br/>- Economically, the use of AI could lead to significant job losses, with some experts estimating that up to 80% of jobs could be lost. Proponents argue that automation will create new jobs, but this does not account for the potential for fully autonomous technology.<br/>- The integration of AI into businesses could lead to the outsourcing of unethical and discriminatory practices to automated systems, providing a layer of plausible deniability for corporations.

- All existing Generative Machine Learning models (GML) are trained on large amounts of data, artwork, and writing, often without the explicit consent of the original creators.<br/>- These models, including midjourney, stable diffusion, chatGPT, and dall-e, exploit the work of artists and writers for corporate profit.<br/>- The following measures are proposed to mitigate this harm:<br/>  - Making it illegal to scrape and train on artists' and writers' work without their explicit consent.<br/>  - All internet content should be assumed to be off-limits for training unless explicit permission is given.<br/>  - Consent clauses hidden in terms of service should be illegal; companies must individually ask each content creator for permission to use their work.<br/>  - Failure to obtain individual permission should be a fineable offence, escalating to a criminal offense if repeated.<br/>  - Profits generated from existing GML models should be taxed at 100%.<br/>  - Companies creating and profiting from these GML models should be fined in proportion to the amount of 'stolen' data they used for training.<br/>- The document concludes by stating that generative machine learning poses a significant threat to the arts and the well-being of creative individuals, and needs to be regulated.

- AI has significant potential in society, particularly as a proof-of-concept tool for tasks such as generating voices for voice actors, creating reference scenes for artists and animators, and producing simple beats for music.<br/>- Problems arise when companies use AI to replace human creators, which can be discouraging for those creators who fear their jobs could be made redundant by AI.<br/>- There are concerns that companies may view AI as a cost-effective alternative to hiring human creators for tasks such as logo design or detailed animation.<br/>- The use of AI should be limited to non-commercial use and should require the consent of creative professionals whose work is used by the AI.<br/>- If creative professionals stop creating due to fears of being replaced by AI, the AI will lack new material to learn from, potentially leading to a stagnation in AI development.<br/>- The use of AI for commercial purposes, such as replacing animators and artists, has led to backlash, as seen with the anime film "The Dog and the Boy" which used AI-generated backgrounds without crediting the original artists.<br/>- The use of AI in a non-commercial context for public access is acceptable, but issues arise when companies use AI to cut corners.<br/>- The complete banning of AI in companies is not feasible due to rapidly advancing technology.<br/>- If a company creates its own AI, hires creative professionals and programmers to train the AI with their own resources, and uses the AI for their own purposes, this is acceptable.<br/>- The main issue currently is theft, with unaccredited individuals being left behind while companies profit from their work.

- AI products are often compared to collage, but the comparison is not entirely accurate.<br/>- Unlike collage, AI takes existing material and combines them without the user knowing the source of all materials.<br/>- Users of AI are not responsible for the conscious choices made in the creation process.<br/>- AI-generated products cannot be subject to copyright or commercial use.<br/>- The dataset used by AI must be free to use, but the resulting product cannot be used for commercial purposes.<br/>- The process of sourcing references and inspiration is a human process, indicating human intent, which AI lacks.<br/>- Even if humans input a single drawing, they have little control over the AI's sourcing, generation, decision-making, or pattern copying.<br/>- Companies using datasets obtained without permission, consent, or compensation and charging others for labor they do not own or pay for, could be committing crimes.<br/>- These crimes could include copyright infringement, theft, plagiarism, human rights violations, labor law violations, identity fraud, and potentially more.

- AI has evolved into a tool that learns from the inputs it receives and outputs a collection of these inputs.<br/>- The user is a creative professional involved in art, design, writing, and photography.<br/>- AI can take language, context, art, likeness, sound, and anything else uploaded on the internet and regurgitate it as best as it's programmed to, similar to a search engine.<br/>- Issues arise when people use AI tools to generate inappropriate or illegal content, such as pornographic images or videos using photos of real people without their permission.<br/>- AI tools can also be used to create music or speeches using people's voices, which can be used for deception.<br/>- AI should function as a tool that does exactly what we want it to do, and if it doesn't, it should be fixed or improved.<br/>- The user suggests limiting what AI feeds off of to prevent it from becoming an unrestricted mirror of the internet.<br/>- While AI tools can do amazing things, they can also be frightening if used without restrictions.

- The advent of public-facing generative AI is compared to the invention of the printing press, as both have significant implications for copyright laws and the protection of authors' rights.<br/>- Mr. Altman is working on a framework to compensate copyright holders for the use of their work in AI training data, but his company has already used copyrighted data without consent or compensation.<br/>- Generative AI services are using training data from non-profit AI research company LAION, which is intended for research purposes only, not commercial use.<br/>- LAION was partially funded by Stability AI, which then used the non-profit's research data to create a commercial AI service.<br/>- The AI models rely heavily on the data they ingest, and the more they train on individual artists' work, the better the results.<br/>- Services like Dall-E can generate countless images that resemble the work of living artists, potentially devaluing the original artist's work and serving as a replacement for commissioned images, without compensating the original artist.<br/>- There could be a chilling effect on creativity if generative AI companies are allowed to use creators' works and names without compensation.<br/>- A lawsuit is underway, invoking the "Right to Publicity" to challenge the use of artists' names in paid services.<br/>- AI services could also negatively impact news media by training on news sites' copyrighted material without compensation, potentially cutting out ad revenue for the news websites.<br/>- A government licensing scheme for AI models may not be realistic, as models can be downloaded for free and used by individuals at home.<br/>- Larger, corporate AI services could be regulated, but the motives of those supporting such regulation, like Mr. Altman, may be suspect.<br/>- The idea of requiring major players to disclose their training data and compensate copyright holders for the use of their copyrighted material is supported.

- AI programs are being trained on existing works in art, literature, and sound recording without the consent of the original creators.<br/>- These AI programs exist outside of "fair use" laws as they are intended for profit-making, unlike fan-made productions based on copyrighted materials.<br/>- Large media companies plan to use AI programs to replace human writers, a for-profit intention, without compensating the original creators of the works used to form the AI databases.<br/>- The current state of AI technology is considered unethical and illegal due to this lack of compensation.<br/>- Regulations are needed to require compensation to creators for the work that AI programs draw from, both retroactively and for future endeavors.<br/>- The "opt out" approach, where unethical practices continue until someone objects, is not acceptable.<br/>- US law has declared that there are circumstances where "opting out" is not enough, and unethical practices must be made ethical or stopped.<br/>- AI programs cannot function without the existing work of human beings, who are entitled to compensation for their work.<br/>- The lack of compensation is seen as exploitation or even slavery, and taking what one has not paid for is theft.<br/>- Federal regulation is urgently needed to protect media creators from AI exploitation, as further delay could lead to extensive litigation in the future.

1. The document discusses the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to induce mental atrophy and its possible negative impact on human cognitive abilities.<br/>2. Over-reliance on AI could lead to mental atrophy in humans, as it may decrease the need for human cognitive effort.<br/>3. AI can be classified into two categories: weak AI, which performs specific tasks, and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which aims to perform any intellectual task at a level or higher than humans.<br/>4. AI has the potential to revolutionize many industries, including healthcare, finance, and transportation, but there are concerns about its impact on employment and potential for bias or unethical decisions.<br/>5. ChatGPT is an AI language model that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to analyze and understand human language.<br/>6. AI is necessary in various aspects of contemporary life, including complex problem-solving, data analysis, and optimization of energy consumption and transportation efficiency.<br/>7. Geoffrey Hinton, a prominent AI developer, left his job at Google due to concerns about AI’s rapid, unregulated development.<br/>8. Many countries outside the U.S. have regulated AI systems like ChatGPT.<br/>9. The European Commission has implemented broad, temporary regulations on AI development, use, and information gathering.<br/>10.

- AI accountability is crucial in both business and personal contexts.<br/>- Internal and external audits and assessments should be used to maintain accountability in the corporate world.<br/>- These audits ensure that AI is being used ethically and help in refining internal processes.<br/>- External auditors can provide a check and balance for internal audits, identifying any oversights or misinterpretations.<br/>- Audit results should be made public to ensure transparency.<br/>- AI should not be the sole decision-maker, especially in personal matters.<br/>- AI should serve as a decision advisor, providing a second opinion to professionals.<br/>- Human professionals should have the final say in decisions, as AI cannot fully interpret emotional and personal aspects.<br/>- For instance, while AI can suggest medication for a patient, the final decision should be made by a doctor.<br/>- AI accountability should uphold human rights, privacy protection, security, diversity, equity, inclusion, and access.

- Artistic labor and intellectual property laws need to be recognized and defended by politicians.<br/>- Datasets trained on copyrighted material are seen as perpetrating theft and forgery on a large scale.<br/>- Until these datasets are purged and re-trained on work licensed or donated by human artists, AI is considered a criminal enterprise.<br/>- The current model is seen as a theft of time, skill, education, and identity of every living illustrator and artist.<br/>- The proposed solution is an opt-in model where artists willingly contribute their work for AI training.

- AI is increasingly being used in art and literature creation, but its usage needs regulation.<br/>- Private companies are looking to replace human creativity and jobs with AI, which could negatively impact the entertainment industry.<br/>- AI lacks the ability to self-correct and relies on a database of collected information, which could lead to increased unemployment rates among writers.<br/>- AI-created artwork is often passed off as human-made, which is deceitful as it doesn't require the same understanding of composition, color, light and shadow, and form and figure.<br/>- AI tools are often used to generate free assets for projects, despite the availability of free resources online.<br/>- AI tools often pull from databases of stolen artworks, which is disrespectful to the original artists and unethical.<br/>- AI users have attempted to recreate works of deceased artists, which is considered unethical and cruel.<br/>- AI databases should only be constructed from media that creators and owners have consented to be used.<br/>- AI tools should disclose their information sources for user transparency.<br/>- AI exploitation is prevalent, with workers in third-world countries being paid poorly to sift through AI content and exposed to traumatic content.<br/>- Regulations around working conditions, pay, and outsourcing of AI services are needed to improve the quality of life for these workers.

I need it to be clear that artists, far and wide, including myself, want it to be a OPT-IN process when it comes to where the data used in AI image generators. We as working citizens, who often find ourselves in difficult situations finding our work appreciated, do not want our work taken for granted and used without our consent.

- Heavy regulations on AI are necessary to protect the work and rights of creatives.<br/>- Current AI databases have appropriated the work of millions to billions of creatives, potentially infringing on privacy and sensitive information.<br/>- The widespread use of AI can devalue art and facilitate harmful practices such as creating deepfakes for political manipulation or non-consensual explicit content.<br/>- Opt-out systems are impractical for artists who have hundreds to thousands of their works incorporated into AI systems, as it would be too time-consuming.<br/>- Companies should implement mandatory opt-in systems and strong regulations, including compensation for creatives whose work is used.<br/>- AI regulations should be overseen by the creatives most affected by them, rather than the companies developing the AI, to prevent exploitation and ensure fair practices.

I’m less concerned about what AI can do than how corporations will use it against us. Execs already see people as widgets that cost them money. They won’t use AI to improve products or productivity. They’ll use it to make bigger margins at the cost of our livelihoods.

Artificial Intelligence needs to be limited. It can't be allowed to extend to the point that it replaces valuable jobs within our society; it can be allowed to consume information and churn that information back out without crediting the source. It should not be used in any form of identity theft including manufacturing photos, voice replication, and or the appearance of a person dead or alive.

- AI is not suitable for handling situations like the opioid crisis, which is actually an "Illicitly manufactured Fentanyl crisis".<br/>- The one-size-fits-all approach is inappropriate in this context.<br/>- There have been numerous cases of patients being abruptly tapered or abandoned, leading to suffering and even suicides.<br/>- Decisions about patient care should be made by healthcare workers, not AI or non-medical personnel.<br/>- Over the past 12 years, non-medical decision-making has led to a 60% decrease in opioid prescriptions, pharmacy backorders, and patients being abandoned.<br/>- Patients who are abandoned may turn to street drugs, potentially leading to unintentional consumption of illicitly manufactured Fentanyl and death.<br/>- The number of deaths due to unintentional consumption or planned suicides is unknown, raising questions about the accuracy of data fed into AI.<br/>- Patients need care from qualified, educated, and experienced humans, not algorithms.<br/>- The CDC 2023 guidelines, like the 2016 version, have not been helpful and should be rescinded.<br/>- State medical boards need to listen to patients and knowledgeable doctors.<br/>- The DEA should focus on the real problem, illicitly manufactured Fentanyl, rather than targeting good doctors and pain patients.
